Handing the current page to an AI assistant is straightforward. Each tool accepts a simple URL with a query string describing what to open. Once the page address is encoded, even a regular link or button is sufficient.

## Base links to remember

- **ChatGPT**: `https://chatgpt.com?q=`
- **Claude**: `https://claude.ai/new?q=`
- **v0**: `https://v0.dev?q=`

Providers tweak these paths from time to time, so inspect their "share" or "new chat" buttons in DevTools if something changes. The workflow stays the same: append the target page as the query value.

## Build the URL in one line

```ts
const chatgpt = `https://chatgpt.com?q=${encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)}`;
```

That is the core idea. Swap the base and reuse the same `encodeURIComponent` call for Claude or v0. No extra scripts are required.

## Hook it up to any button

```tsx
<a href={chatgpt} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Open in ChatGPT
</a>
```

For multiple buttons, store the encoded page once and interpolate it into each URL.

```ts
const page = encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);

const links = {
  chatgpt: `https://chatgpt.com?q=${page}`,
  claude: `https://claude.ai/new?q=${page}`,
  v0: `https://v0.dev?q=${page}`,
};
```

## Add guidance for the assistant

Link targets can include lightweight instructions so the assistant knows what to do with the shared page.

```ts
function getPromptUrl(base: string, pageUrl: string) {
  const message = `I'm reviewing this page: ${pageUrl}.
Help explain the concepts, propose examples, and assist with debugging based on it.`;
  return `${base}${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;
}

const prompts = {
  chatgpt: getPromptUrl("https://chatgpt.com?q=", window.location.href),
  claude: getPromptUrl("https://claude.ai/new?q=", window.location.href),
  v0: getPromptUrl("https://v0.dev?q=", window.location.href),
};
```

Drop those into any UI and the LLM receives the exact page, along with guidance about the expected assistance, via the query string for a single-click hand-off experience.
