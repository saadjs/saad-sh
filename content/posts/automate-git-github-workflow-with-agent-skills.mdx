I built these 3 skills to speed up and automate my Git and GitHub workflow which saves me a lot of time every day.

## Skills Source

https://github.com/saadjs/agent-skills/tree/main/skills

This is the loop I run daily:

- `git-incremental-commits`: split messy working trees into clean commits
- `gh-pr-create`: push + open a PR with a consistent body
- `gh-address-pr-comments`: fetch feedback, add regressions, fix, push, reply

### 1) `git-incremental-commits`

Goal: turn “a pile of changes” into small Conventional Commits, ending with a clean `git status`.

What it automates (for me): deciding commit boundaries, staging strategy, and commit messages.

Typical command pattern:

```bash
git status -sb
git diff --stat

git add -p
git commit -m "feat(scope): …"

# repeat until clean
```

Built-in guardrails I like:

- Won’t commit on `main`/`master` (branch safety gate)
- Encourages lockfiles to be committed with dependency changes
- Prefers single-purpose commits (uses `git add -p` when needed)

### 2) `gh-pr-create`

Goal: after the branch is clean, push and open a PR with a predictable structure.

Preconditions:

```bash
git status -sb
gh auth status
```

Workflow:

```bash
# first push sets upstream
git push -u origin HEAD

# next pushes are just
git push
```

The value is the PR body format. I keep it the same every time:

- `## Summary`
- `## Major changes`
- Optional: `## Screenshots`, `## Tests`, `## Additional info`

That consistency makes PRs easier to scan and review.

After the PR is created, the skill asks who to request review from and applies the right action.

### 3) `gh-address-pr-comments`

Goal: turn PR feedback into an evidence-based checklist and ship the fixes end-to-end.

Required input: a PR number.

Core flow:

```bash
# checkout PR branch
gh pr checkout "$PR_NUMBER"

# fetch PR + comments (inline + issue comments)
gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json number,title,url,headRefName,baseRefName,comments,reviews
```

What it enforces:

- Classify feedback (meaningful vs subjective/unclear)
- Add regression tests before fixes (when testable)
- Run the full test suite before pushing
- Reply to threads with what changed + commit SHA(s)
- Re-request review only after everything is pushed

I usually use `$<skill>` to invoke the skill in Codex CLI or app.
